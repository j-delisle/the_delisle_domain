        <h2 class="bio-heading">Howdy, and welcome to my blog! </h2>
        <p>
            Let me formally introduce myself - My name is <span class="name">Jay Delisle</span>. I currently work as a
            <span class="job">software
                automation engineer </span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I mainly work with Python while at my day job, but I am learning web development and Javascript in the after
            hours! I use this blog as a place where I can help others in the life-learning
            journey of being a software engineer. I've been programming since highschool - however, I graduated college
            with a
            degree in Mechanical Engineering. I'm a mechie turned software engineer. I want to take you along on this
            process to
            help you learn, and to share with you the knowledge that I acquire along the way.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm an engineer at heart - I love to tinker, solve problems, and see how things work. I like to
            build and create both with my hands and with my mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            Aside from code - I'm passionate about motorcycles, cars, and I enjoy spending time outdoors.
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm looking
            forward for you to get to know me and learn with me as I dive into software, tech, and business.
