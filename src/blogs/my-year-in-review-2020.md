2020 was a year to remember. It had a lot of down points for sure. But just like anytime in life, there is always ups AND downs. So, to start the new year I wanted to look back at 2020 and go over some of the good things that happened.<br>
<br>

## 1. My First Software Engineering Job
<br>
To start the year, I started work at my first software engineering job. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and was working in that field before making the switch to software engineering (I'll have a blog post on how I switched careers in the future - stay tuned!). I was miserable in my last job and just was not enjoying it whatsoever. I knew software was the route I wanted to go. After just over a year of learning software development - I had my first offer. <br>
<br>
I love the work I do now. I'm a Test Automation Engineer and I primarily work with Python, which is great. Through this year of work, I improved upon my python skills tremendously. I gained real world development experience in python, testing, SQL and database usage, and much more. It was a year of learning. I had to learn about the tech stack in use, I had to learn the testing framework that we used, the codebase, and the standards that we followed. I look forward to the coming year as I continue to grow more and more!<br>
<br>

## 2. I Launched My First Website
<br>
This year was the year I developed and launched my first live website - This blog site! This was a big accomplishment for me. My day job doesn't deal with web development. It is something I just like and continue to learn more about on the side. Through the year I continued to improve my python skills at work and my web development skills in the after hours of work. I got to the point where I was feeling confident and decided to launch my personal blog site. I intend for this blog to be a place for others to follow along and learn with me as I document my journey and new findings.<br>
<br>
I will say, if you want to learn to code, or get better, then just build and launch something. I learned more in the two months after launching my site than I did the 6 months prior. Between figuring out how to do things from other sites and fixing errors and bugs I learned so much. I love [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), so I started looking into [Static Site Generators](https://jamstack.org/generators/) and feel they are a great tool. This was the tech that started my web development journey and you can definitely expect more posts on SSG's and Jamstack to come!<br>
<br>

## 3. Started Blogging
<br>
I always wanted to have/start a blog. I love teaching others. I love teaching others through my experience even more. I like to be real with people and by starting this blog, I can help others learn to code, learn new tech, or help them solve a problem. Blogging is also a great way to document your journey, what you have learned and are continuing to learn. It makes writing a year in review recap blog post easier too! ;) I look forward to continuing to build my technical writing skills, document my journey, and helping others through blogging this coming year. <br>
<br>

## 4. Skills Improved
<br>
Through this year I learned new technologies and improved upon my skills as a developer.

- Python - have a deeper understanding and fluency in the language which helps me in my career
- SQL - learned how to query and work with databases and continue to improve upon my SQL and database skillset at my day job
- Static Site Generators - as mentioned above I love SSG's and feel they are a great tool for web development today. This year I used mainly two when developing and practicing my web development skills
  - [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - which this blog is built with
  - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - I find it easy to work with and fits my development process well
- Tailwind - I used tailwind css to build this site and to be honest, feel I will use it on every project going forward. It is just a pleasure to use for me. I like keeping my HTML and styling together - less file switching and better efficiency.<br>
<br>
Yes, 2020 was a year that will be remembered, for obvious reasons, but there was still a lot of good to come out of it!<br>
<br>
I look forward to the new year as I continue to grow as an engineer, write more blog posts, and help others.
Stay tuned for my next post on my goals and learning path for this year!<br>
