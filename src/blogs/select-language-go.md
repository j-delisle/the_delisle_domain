I'm a life long learner - it is one of the main reasons I switched into software development. A developer who wants to be at the top of their game must continue to learn and grow with the technology to stay relevant and experienced. I've been learning and using python strictly for about a year and a half now. I feel confident in python and using it. So I felt it was time to start learning a new language - [GoLang](https://golang.org/)

## Why

I feel it is time to start expanding my programming knowledge to be more than just python. I have a pretty good handle on HTML and css and have dipped my toes in Javascript. However, I wanted to learn another language that was quick and not C! I've been reading [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_0/132-8791737-6362063?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0135957052&pd_rd_r=6a07b4cd-84cd-432b-af0f-ced97e21da7c&pd_rd_w=KnrkY&pd_rd_wg=0zM5P&pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&pf_rd_r=F1FXKRV1P5476QME4CC7&psc=1&refRID=F1FXKRV1P5476QME4CC7) and it points out the importance of continuing to learn new languages. The author recommends trying to learn a new language per year. It creates a positive force of seeing and solving problems differently due to knowing other languages, which strengthens one's technical abilities overall.

## Great - but Why Go?

There are a few reasons why I decided to start my next journey with Go. I've always been more keen on backend software, writing APIs, and how things work under the trunk. I never gravitated to the frontend, with design and software appearance/interaction. Go is a great backend and systems language. I've seen it listed with python as requirements for new engineers at the specific companies that I aspire to be a part of at some point in my career. So if that's the case I need to learn Go then! Another reason - [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Lately, I've been diving into the [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) and static site generators. I started to explore and use Hugo as it's been a staple in the community for some time and is known for its incredible build speeds. After tinkering around with it shortly, I fell in love with its simplicity and power! I'm sure I'll convert this site to Hugo in the future, as any developer would change their blog to the new technology they are using ðŸ¤£

## Go Specifics

Go was developed at Google in 2007 and is very similar to C when it comes to its syntax. Unlike C though, it has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The above is how Wikipedia describes Go. To me, it means, Go takes the performance and speed of C without the negatives. To be honest, I don't know a lot about the language, and part of picking it is I just think I'll enjoy it. It will be my first statically typed language and I look forward to everything I learn and can do with Go. Be prepared to see some more posts on [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) specifically as I dive headfirst into building things with Go!

Stay tuned and as always - stay coding!
